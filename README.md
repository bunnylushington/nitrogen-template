This is a simplistic Rebar3 template for creating a Nitrogen application.  To use it, clone this repository and link the resulting directory to `~/.config/rebar3/templates/nitrogen`.  You can then run `rebar3 new nitrogen my_app` to create an application.  To run it, `cd my_app && rebar3 shell`.

I know this is a hack and there are features missing (for instance, only Cowboy is supported as the simple_bridge back end) ... pull requests are welcome.
